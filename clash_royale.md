## Overview

Clash Royale is a real-time strategy game developed and published by Supercell. It combines elements of collectible card games, tower defense, and multiplayer online battle arenas. Set in the same universe as Clash of Clans, the game features familiar characters alongside new ones called "Royales." Players build decks of cards and duel in real-time, aiming to destroy the opponent's towers while defending their own.

## Story & Atmosphere

Like its predecessor, Clash Royale lacks a traditional narrative but thrives on its vibrant, lighthearted atmosphere. The "story" is the competitive climb up the arenas, each with a distinct visual theme—from the Goblin Stadium to the Legendary Arena. The sound design, from the fanfare of starting a match to the distinct audio cues of troops, creates an engaging and recognizable environment.

## Gameplay

The gameplay is fast-paced and strategic. Matches are short (usually 3 minutes), demanding quick decision-making and precise timing. The core loop involves collecting cards to upgrade troops, spells, and defenses, and then using them to outsmart opponents in 1v1 or 2v2 battles. At 6 hours and 11 minutes of play, the initial learning curve involves understanding elixir management and unit counters. The game's matchmaking and progression system provide a steady stream of rewards and new cards to experiment with.

## Verdict

Rating and Verdict is still on process. I don't know how much I like this game until i play a significant amount of time.
