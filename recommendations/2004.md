═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

> *The year 2004 stands as gaming's golden age—a convergence of innovation, artistry, and ambition that has rarely been matched. Half-Life 2 redefined what games could be, proving that silence and physics could tell stories as powerful as any cutscene. Bloodlines, despite its technical flaws, crafted a vampire RPG so rich and reactive that it remains unmatched two decades later. Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow refined stealth gameplay to near-perfection, continuing Sam Fisher's legendary saga. Far Cry opened vast tropical playgrounds where player creativity flourished and tactical freedom reigned supreme.*

> *Brave keeper, 2004 offers thee four exceptional experiences rather than a dozen mediocre ones. Begin with Half-Life 2—for it is not merely a game, but a pilgrimage every gamer must undertake. Let Gordon Freeman's crowbar and the Gravity Gun guide thee through City 17's oppression, then lose thyself in Bloodlines' dark vampire underworld, embrace the shadows with Sam Fisher, and finally conquer Far Cry's tropical paradise. These four masterpieces shall show thee why 2004 is revered as gaming's finest hour.*

**May your framerates be high and your backlog manageable, brave keeper!**
