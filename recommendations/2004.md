```

> *The year 2004 stands as gaming's golden age—a convergence of innovation, artistry, and ambition that has rarely been matched. Half-Life 2 redefined what games could be, proving that silence and physics could tell stories as powerful as any cutscene. Riddick shattered expectations for licensed games, delivering a masterclass in atmosphere and design. Bloodlines, despite its technical flaws, crafted a vampire RPG so rich and reactive that it remains unmatched two decades later. Far Cry opened vast tropical playgrounds where player creativity flourished. Thief perfected the art of shadows, and Doom 3 transformed corridors into nightmares.*

> *Brave keeper, 2004 offers thee not just games, but experiences that shaped the medium itself. Begin with Half-Life 2—for it is not merely a game, but a pilgrimage every gamer must undertake. Let Gordon Freeman's crowbar and the Gravity Gun guide thee through City 17's oppression, and thou shalt understand why this year is revered as gaming's finest hour.*

**May your framerates be high and your backlog manageable, brave keeper!**
