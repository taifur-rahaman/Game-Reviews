```

> *The year 2002 was a golden age—where Vice City's neon glow illuminated the path forward, where Morrowind's alien landscapes beckoned explorers, where Mafia's prohibition-era streets whispered tales of power and betrayal, and where Syberia's dreamlike automatons danced through forgotten memories. Thou hast already conquered four legends from this era. Now, brave keeper, let Mafia's cinematic crime saga be thy next conquest, followed by Morrowind's vast world. The journey from 2002 to 2009 shall be legendary.*

**May your framerates be high and your backlog manageable, brave keeper!**
