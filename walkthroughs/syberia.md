## General Tips

*   **Controls:** Left-click to move/interact. Double-click to run. Right-click for inventory.
*   **Documents:** Read every document (Click the "Eye" icon in inventory). They act as triggers for dialogue and phone numbers.
*   **Phone:** Use your cell phone to call numbers found in documents.
*   **Momo:** He is annoying but useful. Use him when brute force is needed.
