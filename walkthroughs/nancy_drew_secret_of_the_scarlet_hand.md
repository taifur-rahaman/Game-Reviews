## General Tips

*   **Difficulty Modes:** Choose between **Junior Detective** (more hints, easier puzzles) and **Senior Detective** (harder challenges, fewer hints).
*   **Talk to Everyone:** Talk to Joanna, Henrik, Alejandro, and Taylor repeatedly. If stuck, go do a lap and talk to everyone again. Interaction is key.
*   **Phone Calls:** Call Bess and George for hints. Don't forget to call numbers you find in documents!
*   **To-Do List:** Check Nancy's desk in the lab regularly. It tracks your progress.
*   **Save Often:** Especially before attempting the Temple Maze or major puzzles.
*   **Key Concept - Mayan Numbers:** 
    *   **Shell** = 0
    *   **Dot** = 1
    *   **Bar** = 5
    *   Read numbers bottom to top. 
    *   *Example:* One dot over three bars = (1 * 20) + (15 * 1) = 35.

## Part 1: Museum Orientation

### Nancy's Hotel Room
1.  **Starting Out:**
    *   Exit the room. You can't do much here yet. Head straight to the museum.

### Beech Hill Museum - First Day
1.  **Lobby:**
    *   Talk to the guard at the desk (if present).
    *   Look at the "Coming Soon" sign for the Monolith.
2.  **Meeting Joanna (The Boss):**
    *   Go to **Joanna Riggs' office**.
    *   Talk to her exhaustively about the internship.
    *   Get the **Lab Key**.
3.  **The Lab:**
    *   Go to the Lab (back of the museum). Use **Lab Key** to enter.
    *   **Nancy's Desk:** Read the "To Do" list.
    *   **Henrik:** Talk to Henrik Van Der Hune (the guy in the lab). Ask about everything.
4.  **Meeting Alejandro:**
    *   Go to the Shipping/Receiving room (near the lab).
    *   Talk to Alejandro del Rio. He's... passionate.
5.  **Meeting Taylor:**
    *   You can't meet him in person yet. Call **Taylor Sinclair** from the office phone (number on Rolodex/list).

## Part 2: The Broken Pot & Lab Work

### Assembling the Vase
1.  **The Pieces:**
    *   Find the box of pottery shards on the workbench in the lab.
2.  **Puzzle:**
    *   Assemble the pot. Left-click to pick up, right-click to rotate.
    *   *Strategy:* Match the red painted figures. The rim pieces are distinct.
    *   Once finished, note the glyphs: **King**, **Pacal**, **Rabbit**, **Shield**, **Snake**.

### The Mayan Number Displays
1.  **Exhibit Hall:**
    *   Go to the Number Wheel display in the main hall.
    *   **Puzzle:** Match the Arabic numbers to Mayan glyphs.
    *   *Solution:* 
        *   81 = 4 dots (top), 1 dot (bottom).
        *   Just counting dots (1) and bars (5) usually works for simple numbers.
    *   Take the **Quisling Report** if offered or directed.

    *   Exit museum. Go to **Mexican Consulate** on the map.
    *   Talk to the automated robot/system? No, usually you verify the provenance.
    *   *Note:* You might need to make calls to verifying agencies first.

### Sonny's Disk
1.  **Finding the Disk:**
    *   Look around the lab/office area. You find a floppy disk labeled "Sonny".
    *   Insert it into the computer.
2.  **Password:**
    *   The computer asks for a password.
    *   **Clue:** Sonny loved Koko Kringle bars.
