## Part 4: The Theft Investigation

### The Crime Scene

1.  **The Stolen Artifact:**
    *   You'll learn that a jade carving of **King Pacal** was stolen.
    *   The thief left a mysterious **red handprint** at the scene.
    *   This is the signature of the "Scarlet Hand."

2.  **Analyzing the Handprint:**
    *   Go to the lab and use the **Microscope**.
    *   Examine the sample of the red substance.
    ![Spectro X Archeo-analyze Device](images/nancy_drew/nancy6_16.jpg)
    *   **Discovery:** It's not blood - it's **Cinnabar** (mercury sulfide).
    *   The Maya used cinnabar to highlight carvings.

3.  **The Red Hand Letter:**
    *   Check your desk - you'll receive a threatening letter.
    *   It's signed with a red handprint.
    *   The letter contains cryptic clues about the theft.

### Task 4: Analyze the Letter

1.  **The Cipher:**
    *   The letter contains encoded text.
    *   You need to decipher it using a substitution cipher.

2.  **Finding the Key:**
    *   In the lab, check the bookshelves.
    *   Find the book on **Mayan Glyphs and Numbers**.
    *   This will help you decode the message.

3.  **Decoding Process:**
    *   Use the computer in the lab.
    *   Open the "Cipher Tool" program.
    *   Input the encoded text from the letter.
    *   Use the Mayan number system as the key:
        *   Dots = 1
        *   Bars = 5
        *   Shell = 0
    *   **Solution:** The decoded message reveals a warning about the museum's secrets.

### Investigating Suspects

1.  **Questioning Henrik:**
    *   Talk to Henrik about the theft.
    *   Ask him: "Where were you when the artifact was stolen?"
    *   He provides an alibi but seems defensive.
    *   Ask about his research - he's studying the monolith.

2.  **Questioning Alejandro:**
    *   Find Alejandro and ask about the theft.
    *   He mentions seeing someone suspicious near the storage room.
    *   Ask him about his background - he's from Mexico.

3.  **Checking Security:**
    *   In Joanna's office, check the security logs.
    *   Note the times when people entered and exited the museum.
    *   Cross-reference with the time of the theft.

        *   **Ahau Kin** - Sun God
        *   **Chac** - Rain God
        *   **Pacal** - Shield/King

3.  **Translation Process:**
    *   Click on each glyph on the monolith.
    *   Match it with the correct meaning from your research.
    ![Temple Key Card with Glyphs](images/nancy_drew/nancy6_3.jpg)
    *   **Solution Pattern:**
        *   Top row: Gods (Itzamna, Ixchel, Ahau Kin)
        *   Middle row: Elements (Rain, Sun, Moon)
        *   Bottom row: Rulers (Pacal, dates, locations)

4.  **The Hidden Message:**
    *   Once translated correctly, the monolith reveals a hidden compartment.
    *   Click on the specific glyph sequence to open it.
    *   Inside, you find a **Secret Document**.

### The Secret Document

1.  **Reading the Document:**
    *   The document is in Spanish and Mayan.
    *   It references a hidden treasure or artifact.
    *   It mentions "the hand that protects."
