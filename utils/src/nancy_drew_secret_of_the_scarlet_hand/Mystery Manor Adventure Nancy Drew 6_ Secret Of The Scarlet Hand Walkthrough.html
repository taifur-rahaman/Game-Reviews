<p align="center"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;Walkthrough by Louis Koot</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font face="Arial">This walkthrough was written for a Senior Detective.</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>For the sake of clarity in the walkthrough, I have disabled the "Auto Move" function in the "Game Setup". This means that you do not automatically turn left or right when you place the cursor in the game on the left or right side of the screen. You then have to click with your mouse to rotate. I found that automatic turning difficult. So I will always mention how many times you have to click.
When the walkthrough says, go left or go right, it means that you have to click the right or left arrow. By
Zoom Out in the walkthrough I mean the Backwards Arrow that you get at the bottom of your screen when you are focused on something.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>The time keeps running in the game. This may mean that certain people you need to talk to will not be there at certain times. In Nancy's hotel room you can "advance" the time in the game via the alarm clock. You'll actually have to do this a few times in the game. In the walkthrough I cover Nancy's hotel room at the moment when it is really necessary to go there for the first time.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>You have to talk to several people in this game and often have different conversations with the same people, including by telephone. You will almost always receive several conversation options from which you can choose. Your choice often determines how the conversation goes and also whether the things that should happen happen afterwards. Although I explain in the walkthrough which sentences you should use in various conversations, it is better to always save before a conversation.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="5" face="Arial">Part 1: The 5 Tasks</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="5" face="Arial">Start: Museum</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><i><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#000080">The game begins with Nancy reading aloud a letter she wrote to her father. Nancy is currently "Between Cases" and therefore has nothing to do. Fortunately, her father's friend, Franklin Rose, got her the job of assistant curator at the Beech Hill museum in Washington DC. The museum is currently closed to the public as it is being prepared for an exhibition on Mayan Culture and the centerpiece of this exhibition will be an antique Monolith with a number of Glyphs on it.</font></i></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size="3"><strong>When the game starts, Nancy meets her supervisor in the exhibition hall. This is Joanna Riggs and she is showing Nancy the jade carving of King
Pakal. After this, the conversation continues in Joanna's office. Joanna explains some things to Nancy and then you get 2 conversation choices. Choose the second option: </strong></font><font color="#000080"><i><strong><font color="#800080" size="3">"If
there's one thing I'v learned from my father….</font><font size="2">"</font></strong></i></font></font></p>

<p><strong><i><font face="Arial" color="#000080">Joanna then tells Nancy that there is a
To Do List waiting for Nancy in the lab. Then just follow all the possible topics of conversation and you will learn something about Taylor Sinclear, the art buyer for the museum, Hendrik van der Hune, the translator and Alejandro del Rio, the Mexican cultural attaché. Also ask about hieroglyphs and the Monolith.</font></i></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">So after this first conversation you look at Joanna's desk and Joanna is standing to the right of it. Hold your cursor against the right edge of the screen and your cursor will become a set of rotating arrows. Now click with your mouse 11 times to turn clockwise until you see a small table in the corner of the room, to the left of the large bookcase. Then go forward once to this table and zoom in on the
<font color="#990033"> magazines </font><font color="#000000">that are</font><font color="#990033">
</font>on it. The <font color="#000080"> "Art in the Americas" magazine</font> will then appear on your screen. Click on it to open it. It includes a long interview with Prudence Rutherford. Click on
<font color="#000080"> page 27</font> to continue browsing. Then click on <font color="#000080"> page
28</font>. Nancy will then comment: <i><font color="#000080"> “Topeka Commission for the arts….How
cultural”</font></i>. Now you can read through the rest of the magazine. Once you have done that, click on the left pages to close the magazine again and then zoom out twice.</font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#000080">Rotunda</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size="3"><strong>Then turn counterclockwise 6 times, to the door, and go forward 1 time and then open the door via the doorknob. Step forward once into the central hall. Right in front of you is the
<font color="#990033"> ticket sales desk</font>, but first turn completely back to the door of Joanna's office. There is a nameplate on the wall to the left and right of the door. Zoom in on the<font color="#990033">
name plate</font> hanging to the right of the door. This lists the names of the donors to this museum. Zoom in on the bottom half of this
plate&nbsp; Nancy reads and says: </strong></font><font size="3" color="#000080"><strong><i>"Topeka commission for the
arts-thats the organization Produnce Rutherford works for".</i></strong></font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Zoom out twice and turn around again. Now go forward twice to the ticket sales desk and zoom in on the
<font color="#990033"> stack of maps</font> on the left of the counter. On your screen you will now
get a copy of the <font color="#000080"> "a Travelers Guide to Beech Hill
Museum"</font>. On it you see the symbol of the <font color="#000080"> Mayan God
Ekahau</font>, which is the God of Travelers. Open the guide and the inside page reveals a map of the large exhibitionhall. Here you also see 2 images of Mayan Gods. At the top right is<font color="#000080">
Kukulcan</font>, the God of the Wind and at the bottom right is <font color="#000080">Xaman</font>, the God of the North. On this map you can also see that you are currently in the
<font color="#000080"> Rotunda.</font></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial"><img src="./Mystery Manor Adventure Nancy Drew 6_ Secret Of The Scarlet Hand Walkthrough_files/nancy6_2.jpg" width="239" height="379"><img src="./Mystery Manor Adventure Nancy Drew 6_ Secret Of The Scarlet Hand Walkthrough_files/nancy6_3.jpg" width="578" height="379"></font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Close the map and zoom out twice. Now go forward twice, to the left of the
counte,r and you will be behind the counter. On the left is a cabinet with a double glass door and it contains headphones that visitors can rent to receive spoken explanations during their tour through the museum. Zoom in on the<font color="#990033"> glass doors</font> of this cabinet. Click on the button of the left door. Hela...there's no button so you can't open the
cabinet. Zoom out. To your right you will now see a <font color="#990033"> drawer</font> under the counter. Zoom in on this drawer and then open the drawer. Then click on the<font color="#990033">&nbsp;
drawerbox </font> in the drawer to lift it. There are 3 stacks of cards at the bottom of the drawer. Click on the<font color="#990033"> front stack</font> and such a card will now appear on your screen. It is a so-called
<font color="#990033"> Temple card.</font> Notice the symbol of the God<font color="#000080"> Bih,
</font> it is the God of the Way. Click on the card to place it in your inventory.</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial"><img src="./Mystery Manor Adventure Nancy Drew 6_ Secret Of The Scarlet Hand Walkthrough_files/nancy6_4.jpg" width="408" height="259"></font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Close the drawer box and then the drawer and zoom out. Then turn around and go forward once and then left. You are now looking at the large double Golden Doors. That is the entrance and exit of the museum and if you go through these doors you enter the
<font color="#990033">Metro station</font>. But that comes later. To the left of these Golden Doors is an
<font color="#990033"> alcove</font> containing a large red banner about the upcoming exhibition. Go forward once into this alcove. On the left here is a piece of paper on the floor that is folded like a
<font color="#990033"> paper airplane</font>. Zoom in twice on this paper and then click on it to unfold it. Read through it, so
click on the top half. It is a <font color="#000080"> Loan Agreement </font> between the Republic of Mexico and the Beech Hill Museum regarding the loan to the museum of the
<font color="#000080"> Monolith.</font> Zoom out and you will see Joanna Riggs' signature on the contract, but you will also see that the Mexican Cultural Attaché's signature is not yet on the contract.&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3"> Zoom out and the <font color="#990033"> contract
</font> will disappear into your inventory. Zoom out 2 more times and you will look at the Golden Doors again.</font></strong>
<font size="3"><strong>It is high time to start working seriously now. Now turn left 8 times and then go forward 4 times down the stair corridor and you will be in the large exhibition hall. Here, on the left and right in niches, the Mayan Artifacs are exhibited. We'll have to look at them one by one later. At the very back of the room is the large Mayan Pyramid. Go forward 5 times until you are at the bottom of the pyramid and then turn right. You see a door in the wall.</strong></font></font></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#000080">Laboratory</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Go forward to the door 3 times. You read <font color="#000080"> "Employees only"
</font> on this door. Open the door by clicking on the door knob and then go forward once into the hall. There are 2 doors in this hall. The door on the left goes to the
<font color="#000080"> "shipping and receiving"</font> area, the door on the right is the door
off the <font color="#000080">laboratory</font>. Zoom in on the laboratory door and then open it by clicking on the door button. Then go forward once into the laboratory. Stand still for a moment. There is one long work table along three walls of the lab with drawers and items on it. Turn to the left.&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
<p><strong> <font size="3" face="Arial"> You see a young man sitting at a part of the workbench. He has a dust mask over his mouth and is working on an artifact. Click on this young man to have a quick chat with him. He introduces himself as
<font color="#000080"> Hendrik van der Hune </font> and this is the Hendrik that Joanna was already talking about. From the 2 possible answers, now choose the second option:
<i><font color="#000080"> "That's right, I'm Nancy Drew……." </font></i> And after this you just follow every possible conversation option and then you close the conversation.</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="3">Then turn left and you will see a desk to the right of the door. That's Hendrik's desk. Go there. To the right of the desk is a large radio on a table. Zoom in on
that <font color="#990033">radio </font>twice. It is a <font color="#000080"> "Kremercom Morse HAM radio"
</font> with which Morse Code messages can be received and sent. If you click on the
<font color="#990033"> on/off button</font>, Nancy will say that she better ask permission first. Zoom out twice and then zoom in on the<font color="#990033"> row of books</font> on Hendrik's desk. On the left in the row of books you can click on a book and the
<font color="#000080"> Manual of that Morse Radio</font> will appear on your screen. Have a quick look through it.</font></strong>
<strong><font size="3" face="Arial">In addition to the usage instructions, you can also read the complete explanation of all Morse Code letters in this book.&nbsp;</font></strong></font></p>
<p><strong> <font size="3" face="Arial"> Close the booklet and zoom out and then click on the
<font color="#990033"> card</font> that's on the desktop. It is a card from the <font color="#000080"> "Chaco Canyon Cultural Center"</font> and you can read a name on it:
<font color="#000080"> "Sheila Schultz"</font> and a telephone number:<font color="#000080">
1-505-555-1222</font>. Well, you can't do anything else with this, so zoom out of the desk and turn further to the left and you will see another desk to the left of the entrance door. That's
<font color="#000080"> Nancy's desk</font>. Go forward once to this desk. There are a number of things on the desk. There is a book on the left of the desk and the telephone on the right. To the left of the telephone is a clipboard with a paper on it and to the right of the telephone there is a yellowish paper stuck to the desktop. Zoom in once on the telephone and then zoom in twice on the<font color="#990033"> clipboard.</font> A purple note will then appear on the screen.</font></strong></p>

The number is therefore the number of the story that you hear when you click on the green arrow. So each of the 15 boxes has a LETTER and a
Number story. Now click on each of the 15 "boxes" in turn. Always write down the LETTER and NUMBER of the story you hear when you click on the green arrow. Also try to write down at least the first sentence of the stories. Make a list of it.</font></strong></p>

                <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Pakal probably spread them throughout the Mayan empire to prevent them from ever being combined into one key.

  <li><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Frequency 2050 Hz sends you a series of 5 numbers, in Spanish, with each transmission beginning with "Attencion, attencion". So it is also necessary that you learn to count in Spanish up to 9:</font></strong></li>

<p><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Decoding the Numbers:</font></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Write down the last 3 numbers of the series of 5 numbers and then add a 0 to get a 4-digit number.</font></strong></li>
  <li><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Then add the original 5 numbers together and then add the sum to the number from the first step.</font></strong></li>
  <li><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">You then have the 4-digit frequency of the SMUGGLERS STATION.</font></strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">EXAMPLE:</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Suppose you get the station number: 5, 6, 1, 2, 3. Then it is SMUGGLERS STATION: 1247. Why? Here's why:<br>
Step 1 = add a 0 to the last 3 digits = 1230<br>
Step 2 = add the original 5 numbers: 5+6+1+2+3 = 17<br>
Step 3 = add this sum to the first number = 17+1230 =. 1247.</font></strong></p>

Write this down.&nbsp; Then click on B and again on all 6 words. Unfortunately, the combination of A

cube as sides. Because that is what the key, a<font color="#990033"> Cube</font> When you are done you will hear Nancy shout:
<i><font color="#000080"> "Now I have the key".</font></i></font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Click on the<font color="#990033">
Cube</font> to place it in your inventory.</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080">Now of course you have to open the Monolith in the garden with this key, but that is not easy. You need the
Maya Calendar Discs and a specific date for this. Let's first grab those Mayan Calendar
Discs and then click on the Monolith. If you have looked closely at all the Exibits in
all the display cases in the main exhibition hall while performing Task 5, then you will have come across those Mayan Calendar Discs in one of the display cases. Don't remember which display case? Well, go to Niche 5 (the Niche where Exhibit I is, look at Sonny's map if you can't remember which Niche this is).</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">When you are in Niche 5, turn right so that you look at the right display case.&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial"> In this display case, on the right, are the 2 round stone
<font color="#990033"> Tzolkin Calendar Discs.</font></font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial"><img src="./Mystery Manor Adventure Nancy Drew 6_ Secret Of The Scarlet Hand Walkthrough_files/nancy6_39.jpg" width="441" height="245"></font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><strong>Before you open the display case and take out the two discs,
<font color="#990033"> SAVE YOUR GAME HERE.</font> Let me explain first:</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000080"><i>If you pick up the two Stone tzolkin Calendar
discs, Nancy will tell you that those things are very heavy and that she cannot carry these stone
discs for very long. So you have to run like crazy to the Monolith and place these two
discs there on the right side of the Monolith. This right side of the Monolith is the side where Nancy said: "It looks like this side is missing a part". This needs to be done quickly, so it's best to take the path to the left of the pyramid. The route through the garden to the Monolith is then shorter than via the
right path. If you don't make it in time, load your Save or choose the "Second Change" option.</i></font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Now do the following:</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Open the display case with the<font color="#990033"> small key
</font> that you stole from Joanna's desk drawer and then click on the largest disk 3 times. You then pick up BOTH discs.
Nancy screams: <i><font color="#000080"> “Woow, these are heavy”</font></i>.</strong></font>
<font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Zoom out and then click somewhere on the left on the glass of the display case to close it again. Nancy shouts that she won't be able to carry the stones for long.</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Turn Right and go forward twice to leave
Niche 5.</strong></font> <strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Turn left and go forward twice towards the Pyramid</font></strong>
<font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Then aim your forward arrow to the left of the pyramid and then click forward 7 times and you will have entered the garden via the left tunnel.</strong></font>
<strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Go forward 6 times and then right 2 times. 4 times forward and then 2 times left.
Go forward one more time and you will see the Monolith. Now aim your forward arrow to the right of the Monolith and then click forward twice</font></strong>
<strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Turn left and then zoom all the way in to this side of the Monolith.
Again Nancy will say: <font color="#000080"><i> "Something is missing here".</i></font>
Quickly, dive into your inventory and click on the <font color="#990033"> Calendar
Discs</font> and then click them in the circle on the Monolith.</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial">He he…you made it. Okay, now you have to set this Tzolking Calendar to the correct Mayan Date, just like you did with the Calendar Puzzle in the temple. So click on the disks again and you are in the Close-up. Nancy will say:
<font color="#000080"><i> "The Poem said, when the first king ascends again".</i></font></font></strong>
<strong><font size="3" face="Arial">Do you think <font color="#990033"> 12 Kaban</font> is the correct date? Try it. Make sure that the Mayan number 12 is placed behind the line on the left and then rotate the large disk until, one by one, you have ALL the Symbols of the large
disc in front of the line. However Nothing Happens.........Apparently 12 Kaban is not the correct date. So you have to set a different date.</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial" color="#000080">Well...I really thought about letting you figure this out all by yourself.&nbsp;
But I'm a nice guy so here it is. You can actually find the correct date that you now need to enter on this Calendar, near here. You also came across this date when you viewed all 15 Exhibits to complete
Task 5. This date is stated on the sign of one of these 15 Exhibits. If you paid attention and took notes then you now know this date. The Exhibit where you can find this date is EXHIBIT J. And the date is 6 LAMAT</font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><strong>So place the<font color="#990033"> Mayan number 6</font> right behind the line and then rotate the large
disc until you have<font color="#990033"> LAMAT</font> in front of the line.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>You will automatically know that this is the case because you will hear a<font color="#990033"> loud click.</font> You will then see that a
<font color="#990033"> stone is being inserted</font> into one of the other sides of the Monolith and you will then automatically zoom out of this puzzle. Zoom out one more time and then keep your cursor all the way to the left edge of your screen. Your cursor will then become a thick curved arrow. Then click 4 times and turn counterclockwise around the monolith and then look at the side that is immediately left of the side where you did the Calendar puzzle. You now see a
