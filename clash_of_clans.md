## Overview

Clash of Clans is a freemium mobile strategy video game developed and published by Finnish game developer Supercell. The game is set in a fantasy-themed persistent world where the player is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other players through the game's fighting features. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.

## Story & Atmosphere

There isn't a traditional story mode in the sense of a narrative arc, but the game exudes a charming, lighthearted fantasy atmosphere. The goblins serve as the primary antagonists in the single-player campaign, providing a loose structure for early progression. The visual style is colorful and distinct, with sound effects that have become iconic in the mobile gaming space.

## Gameplay

The core gameplay loop involves collecting resources, upgrading buildings, and training troops to raid other players' villages. As a new player (31m in), the initial experience is about setting up the basics: a Town Hall, some resource collectors, and defensive structures. The real depth comes from clan interactions and higher-level strategies, which I have yet to experience fully.

## Verdict

Rating and Verdict is still on process. I don't know how much I like this game until i play a significant amount of time.
