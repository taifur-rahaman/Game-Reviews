## Overview

Company of Heroes is a real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment that revolutionized the genre upon its release in 2006. Set during World War II, it moves away from traditional resource gathering, focusing instead on capturing control points and managing supply lines. The game is renowned for its cinematic presentation, destructible environments, and intense tactical combat.

## Story & Atmosphere

The campaign follows Able Company during the Battle of Normandy, starting with the D-Day landings at Omaha Beach and pushing through the French countryside. The narrative is grounded and gritty, capturing the chaos and heroism of the war. The atmosphere is immersive, with incredible sound design—from the rattle of machine guns to the shouting of soldiers—bringing the battlefield to life.

## Gameplay

Company of Heroes focuses on squad-level tactics and cover mechanics. Units must use the terrain to survive, and the environment itself is dynamic; buildings can be destroyed, leaving behind rubble that offers new cover. Managing resources (Manpower, Munitions, and Fuel) requires controlling territory on the map, forcing aggressive play. At 10 hours and 38 minutes, I am deep into the campaign and learning the nuances of flanking maneuvers and combined arms warfare.

## Verdict

Rating and Verdict are still on process. I don't know how much I like this game until i completed the game.
