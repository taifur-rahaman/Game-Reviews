## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Step 1: Complete the Story on any Difficulty
Enjoy the narrative. Focus on gathering collectibles if you wish, but don't stress about it. You can replay chapters later. Use this run to get familiar with the driving and shooting mechanics.

### Step 2: Classic Difficulty Playthrough
Replay the game on **Classic Difficulty**. This is the hardest challenge. Enemies are lethal, police are strict, and driving is realistic.
*   **Tip**: The race in the mission "Fair Play" is the hardest part. Be patient, use the "ram" button to help cornering, and don't be afraid to restart.

### Step 3: Free Ride (Collectibles & Misc)
Load up "Free Ride" mode to complete the Phone Booth side missions, collect any missing magazines, cigarette cards, and hidden cars, and clean up miscellaneous combat achievements.

## 📝 Keeper's Notes

*   **(Race Tips)**: It took me X tries. The trick is to let off the gas *before* the turn, coast through the apex, then hammer it.
*   **(Classic Mode)**: The shotgun guys in "You Lucky Bastard" are a nightmare. Stay back!
