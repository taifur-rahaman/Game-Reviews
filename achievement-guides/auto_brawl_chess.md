## Understanding the Game Mechanics

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before attempting achievements, you MUST understand these core mechanics.

### 🌟 The Star Level System (CRITICAL)

> [!WARNING]
> **The maximum star level is 4 STARS, not 3!** You need to merge heroes multiple times.

**How Star Levels Work:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    STAR LEVEL PROGRESSION                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│   ⭐ + ⭐ = ⭐⭐                                                  │
│   (1-star) + (1-star) = (2-star hero)                          │
│                                                                 │
│   ⭐⭐ + ⭐⭐ = ⭐⭐⭐                                               │
│   (2-star) + (2-star) = (3-star hero)                          │
│                                                                 │
│   ⭐⭐⭐ + ⭐⭐⭐ = ⭐⭐⭐⭐                                            │
│   (3-star) + (3-star) = (4-star hero) ← MAXIMUM!               │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Total Heroes Needed for 4-Star (Maximum):**

| Star Level | Heroes Needed | Merge Requirement |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| ⭐ (1-star) | 1 copy | Starting unit |
| ⭐⭐ (2-star) | 2 copies | Merge 2x 1-star |
| ⭐⭐⭐ (3-star) | 4 copies | Merge 2x 2-star |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4-star) | **8 copies** | Merge 2x 3-star |

**To get ONE 4-star hero, you need 8 copies total!**

```
Example: Getting 4-star Marilyn

Copy 1 + Copy 2 = 2-star Marilyn (A)
Copy 3 + Copy 4 = 2-star Marilyn (B)
Copy 5 + Copy 6 = 2-star Marilyn (C)
Copy 7 + Copy 8 = 2-star Marilyn (D)

2-star A + 2-star B = 3-star Marilyn (X)
2-star C + 2-star D = 3-star Marilyn (Y)

3-star X + 3-star Y = ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4-STAR MARILYN! (Achievement unlocks!)
```

### 🔗 Faction Synergies (CRITICAL for 11 Achievements)

Many achievements require winning a round with the **HIGHEST faction bonus enabled**. This means you need multiple heroes from the same faction to activate the maximum synergy tier.

| **Orc** | Art of War | Warrior buffs |
| **Reptile** | Scalin' Up! | Poison effects |
| **Tribe** | United We Stand | Team buffs |
| **Undead** | Dead Can Dance | Armor reduction |

**How Faction Bonuses Work:**
- Having 2 heroes of one faction = Tier 1 bonus
- Having 4 heroes of one faction = Tier 2 bonus  
- Having 6+ heroes of one faction = **Highest bonus (Tier 3)** ← Required for achievements!

### 💰 Gold & Economy Management

**How to Earn Gold:**
1. **Passive Income:** Earned each round
2. **Win/Lose Streaks:** Bonus gold for consecutive results
3. **Selling Heroes:** Sell unwanted heroes

| **Star Level Needed** | **4-Star (Maximum)** |
| **Copies Required** | **8 copies of Marilyn** |
| **Difficulty** | 7/10 |
| **Game Mode** | Ranked Match Only |

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Queue for a Ranked Match**

2. **Understand what you need:**
   - You must collect **8 copies** of Marilyn
   - Merge them all the way to 4-star
   - This is very difficult in a single match!

3. **Strategy - Early Game (Rounds 1-10):**
   - Buy EVERY Marilyn you see immediately
   - Save gold but don't over-refresh yet
   - Build a functional team alongside Marilyn hunting
   - Goal: Have at least 2-4 copies by round 10

4. **Strategy - Mid Game (Rounds 11-20):**
   - You should have 2-star Marilyn by now
   - Start aggressive refreshing if you have gold
   - Keep buying every Marilyn
   - Other players might also want Marilyn - compete!
   - Goal: Have 3-star Marilyn (4 copies)

5. **Strategy - Late Game (Rounds 20+):**
   - You need 4 MORE copies to go from 3-star to 4-star
   - Refresh aggressively (spend all gold)
   - You need TWO 3-star Marilyns to merge into 4-star
   - This means: 4 copies → 3-star #1, 4 more copies → 3-star #2

6. **The Merge:**
   - When you have 8 total copies, you'll have two 3-star Marilyns
   - They automatically merge into **4-STAR MARILYN**
   - **Achievement unlocks!** 🎉

**Pro Tips:**
- This is VERY hard to do in one match
- You need luck with shop rolls

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended Order:**
> 1. Complete faction achievements first (easiest - just need 6+ of same faction)
> 2. Work on hero 4-star achievements (need 8 copies each)
> 3. Let Cheating Death happen naturally
> 4. Complete Chess Pass through daily play
> 5. Push leaderboards last

**Good luck on your journey to 100% completion!** 🏆
