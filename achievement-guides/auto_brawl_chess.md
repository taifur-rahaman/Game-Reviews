3. **Late Game:** Spend aggressively to maximize team strength
4. **Board Expansion:** Expand your unit capacity when economically feasible
5. **Rerolling:** Only reroll when looking for specific heroes or upgrades

### Hero Upgrade Priority
1. **Common Heroes Early:** 3-star common heroes > 1-star rare heroes in early game
2. **Rare Heroes Late:** Transition to rare heroes in mid-to-late game
3. **Focus Upgrades:** Better to have one 3-star hero than three 1-star heroes

### Match Strategy
