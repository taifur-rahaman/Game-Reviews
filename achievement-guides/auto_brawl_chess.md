│   ⭐ + ⭐ = ⭐⭐                                                  │
│   (1-star) + (1-star) = (2-star hero)                          │
│                                                                 │

│   (2-star) + (2-star) = (3-star hero) ← MAXIMUM                │

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Understand Dungeon Mechanics:**
   - Dungeon resets weekly
   - You have limited "Life Stones" (lives)
   - Only 4 factions available each week (changes weekly)
   - You collect artifacts that buff your team

2. **Pre-Run Preparation:**
   - Check which 4 factions are available this week
   - Plan synergies around available factions
   - Know the best heroes in those factions

3. **During Your Run:**
   - **Floor 1 Strategy:**
     - Start with low-cost heroes (1-2 gold)
     - Start building synergies immediately
     - Don't spend gold on refreshes yet
     - Clear easier/smaller buildings first
   
   - **Floor 2 Strategy:**
     - You should have 2-star heroes now
     - Select artifacts that match your team
     - Preview enemies before engaging
     - Choose battles you can win
   
   - **Floor 3 Strategy:**
     - Aim for 3-star key heroes
     - Have at least 2 active synergies
     - Position perfectly
     - Choose artifact combinations wisely

4. **Key Tips for Flawless Run:**
   | Tip | Explanation |
   |-----|-------------|
   | Preview battles | Always check enemy composition before fighting |
   | Choose small buildings first | Easier = safer progression |
   | Stack artifacts | Pick artifacts that synergize with each other |
   | Build 2+ synergies | Raw stats < synergy bonuses |
   | 3-star low-cost heroes | Easier to upgrade than high-cost |
   | Position carefully | Tanks front, DPS back, spread out |

5. **If You Lose:**
   - Don't worry - dungeon resets weekly
   - Learn from mistakes
   - Try again with better strategy

> [!TIP]
> Wait until you have good heroes and understand the game before attempting this. New players should practice for a few weeks first.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **This achievement is mostly RNG/luck-based**
   - You cannot control exactly when you'll have 1 HP
   - Play normally and it will happen eventually

2. **Strategy to Increase Chances:**
   - **Build late-game compositions** that scale well
   - **Lose streak strategy:** Intentionally lose early for economy
   - Late game you'll have less HP but stronger team
   - Win the final fights with 1 HP remaining

3. **DO NOT intentionally throw games:**
   - You still need to WIN the match
   - Just have 1 HP when you become 1st place
   - Focus on strong late-game scaling

4. **Best Compositions for This Achievement:**
   - Mage/Shooter backline (strong late game)
   - Guardian frontline (protects your carries)
   - Empire or Demon synergy (high scaling)

5. **What Actually Happens:**
   - You play the match normally
   - Sometimes you get lucky with HP damage
   - You end up in top 2-3 with 1-5 HP
   - Final enemy attacks leave you at exactly 1 HP
   - You win the next fight = Achievement!

> [!NOTE]
> This took me several matches to unlock. Don't stress about it - play normally and it will happen organically. Focus on winning with late-game compositions.
