## Overview

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell introduces Sam Fisher, a highly trained operative working for Third Echelon, a secret branch of the NSA. As a Splinter Cell agent, Fisher operates in the shadows, using stealth, gadgets, and precision to complete missions that officially "never happened." The game revolutionized stealth gameplay with its dynamic light and shadow mechanics, where darkness becomes your greatest ally and every light source is a tactical consideration.
