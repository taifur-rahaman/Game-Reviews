## Overview

Auto Brawl Chess is an auto-battler strategy game that blends elements of RPGs and Collectible Card Games (CCG). Developed by Panoramik Games, it challenges players to build a unique team of heroes, synergies, and strategies to outwit opponents in fast-paced automated battles. The game features a variety of modes, including ranked matchmaking and PvE campaigns, set in a vibrant fantasy world.

*Note: This review is in progress. I will update the playtime every 50 hours.*

## Story & Atmosphere

While the focus is primarily on competitive strategy, the game offers a fantasy setting populated by diverse heroes, from knights and mages to mythical creatures. The visual style is cartoonish and colorful, typical of the genre, creating an accessible yet strategic atmosphere. The "story" is largely emergent, defined by the battles you fight and the team compositions you create.

## Gameplay

The core loop involves purchasing and placing units on a board, managing an economy of gold, and seeking synergies between different unit types and factions. As an "Auto Chess" game, the combat is automated; the player's agency lies in the preparation phase—drafting units, positioning them, and equipping items. With 7 hours and 31 minutes played, I am still exploring the nuances of the meta, unlocking new heroes, and climbing the initial competitive ranks. The blend of idle mechanics with active strategy provides a distinct rhythm compared to traditional auto battlers.

## Verdict

Rating and Verdict is still on process. I don't know how much I like this game until i play a significant amount of time.
