## Notes & Observations

*(These are my raw notes from while I was playing—some spoilers involved!)*

### General Thoughts
*   **Visuals:** The leap from 2002 graphics to this is insane. Lost Heaven looks incredible.
*   **Driving:** The driving model feels weighty, appropriate for the era.
*   **Prologue:** Visually stunning but feels dragged out. "TOO FUCKING LONG."

### Characters
*   **Tommy Angelo:** Seems like an honest, hardworking guy who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. If he hadn't been taking a break that night, he never would have met Sam and Paulie or been targeted by Morello's goons. A victim of circumstance.
*   **Sam:** Gives off a stoic vibe. Calm and collected.
*   **Paulie:** The chaotic element. Seems like the type who would kill you while laughing and joking.
