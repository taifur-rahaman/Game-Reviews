## Overview

Age of Mythology: Retold is a faithful remake of the beloved 2002 classic, bringing the mythological RTS into the modern era with updated graphics, refined mechanics, and quality-of-life improvements. It's a game that walks the delicate line between nostalgia and modernization — sometimes successfully, sometimes not. Over the course of 20 hours, I rediscovered the charm of commanding Greek hoplites alongside minotaurs, Norse warriors blessed by Thor, and Egyptian priests summoning the power of Ra. But beneath the polished surface, I also found a remake that plays it perhaps too safe.

## Story & Atmosphere

The campaign follows Arkantos, an Atlantean admiral, on a mythic journey across the ancient Mediterranean and beyond. The story blends Greek, Norse, and Egyptian mythology into a cohesive narrative filled with gods, monsters, and betrayal. It's pulpy, earnest, and genuinely fun — a Saturday morning cartoon brought to life with strategy gameplay.

The atmosphere benefits greatly from the visual overhaul. The gods feel more present, the mythical creatures more imposing, and the environments more vibrant. Watching a Cyclops hurl boulders at enemy fortifications or a Phoenix rise from the ashes still carries that sense of spectacle the original game nailed. The voice acting and music, while updated, retain the spirit of the 2002 version — familiar, comforting, and appropriately epic.

## Gameplay

At its core, Age of Mythology: Retold is still the same game — gather resources, build bases, worship gods, and crush your enemies with a mix of mortal soldiers and mythological units. The three civilizations (Greek, Norse, Egyptian) each play distinctly, with unique mechanics tied to their pantheons. Choosing which god to worship at each age advancement adds strategic depth and replayability.

The remake introduces some welcome quality-of-life features: improved pathfinding, better unit formations, and a more intuitive UI. The graphics are crisp and modern without losing the game's original charm. However, the AI can still feel dated — predictable in skirmishes and occasionally frustrating in campaign missions. Multiplayer has been revitalized with modern matchmaking and balance tweaks, which is where the game truly shines for competitive players.

But here's where the "Retold" part stumbles: it doesn't take many risks. There's little new content beyond visual upgrades and minor mechanical tweaks. For veterans of the original, it can feel more like a remaster than a true reimagining. The pacing of some campaign missions hasn't aged well, and certain design choices — like resource scarcity or mission objectives — feel archaic compared to modern RTS standards.

## Verdict

After 20 hours, Age of Mythology: Retold is a competent and polished remake that successfully brings a classic into the modern era — but it's also a safe one. It's perfect for those who want to relive the magic of the original with better graphics and smoother gameplay, or for newcomers curious about what made this mythological RTS so beloved. However, it doesn't push boundaries or redefine the experience in meaningful ways.

The game is still fun, still charming, and still capable of delivering those "wow" moments when a god power obliterates an enemy army. But it's also a reminder that nostalgia alone can't carry a remake forever. Age of Mythology: Retold is a respectful tribute to the past — just don't expect it to forge a bold new future.
