## Overview

Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand is the sixth installment in the Nancy Drew PC game series by Her Interactive. You play as Nancy Drew, a teenage detective who takes on an internship at the Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. What starts as a routine museum job quickly turns into a thrilling mystery when a priceless Mayan artifact is stolen, marked by a mysterious red handprint—the signature of the legendary "Scarlet Hand."

The game features a non-linear structure, allowing you to tackle puzzles and tasks in various orders. You'll interact with NPCs like Joanna Riggs (museum curator), Henrik Van Der Hune (Mayan expert), Alejandro del Rio (museum employee), and Taylor Sinclair (intern coordinator). The game offers two difficulty modes: Junior Detective (more hints, easier puzzles) and Senior Detective (fewer hints, harder challenges).
