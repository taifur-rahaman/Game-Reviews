## Overview

Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand is the sixth installment in the Nancy Drew PC game series by Her Interactive. You play as Nancy Drew, a teenage detective who takes on an internship at the Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. What starts as a routine museum job quickly turns into a thrilling mystery when a priceless Mayan artifact is stolen, marked by a mysterious red handprint—the signature of the legendary "Scarlet Hand."

## Story & Atmosphere

The game opens with Nancy Drew arriving at the prestigious **Beech Hill Museum** in Washington D.C. for what should be a straightforward internship. Instead, she walks into a crime scene: a priceless jade carving of **King Pacal** has been stolen, and the thief left behind a dramatic calling card—a **red handprint** made from **Cinnabar** (mercury sulfide), the same toxic pigment the ancient Maya used to highlight their sacred carvings.

The atmosphere is steeped in Maya history and mythology. The museum itself feels like a crash course in ancient Mesoamerican culture, with artifacts, glyphs, and references to gods like **Itzamna** (the supreme creator), **Ixchel** (the dual-natured moon goddess), **Ahau Kin** (the sun god who transforms into a jaguar at night), and **Xbalanque** (the legendary Hero Twin). The game doesn't just use Maya culture as window dressing—it weaves it into the mystery itself, making you feel like you're uncovering layers of both ancient and modern secrets.

You'll work under **Joanna Riggs**, the museum curator who radiates "rigid academic" energy and cares deeply about the museum's reputation. Your workspace once belonged to **Sonny Joon**, a previous intern with a reputation for being "wacky" and obsessed with aliens—his doodles and notes are scattered around, adding a quirky layer to the mystery. The game balances educational content with engaging detective work, turning the museum into both a classroom and a crime scene.

## Gameplay

**Secret of the Scarlet Hand** is a classic first-person point-and-click adventure. You navigate the museum by clicking on hotspots, examining artifacts, solving puzzles, and talking to NPCs. The game has a **non-linear structure**, meaning you can tackle many tasks in whatever order you prefer, though some puzzles naturally gate your progress.

The puzzles are varied and often educational. You'll decipher **Maya glyphs**, solve **number puzzles** based on the ancient Maya counting system, assemble a **broken vase** (a surprisingly meditative task), and investigate clues left behind by the mysterious thief. The game does an excellent job of integrating its puzzles with the Maya theme—you're not just solving arbitrary riddles; you're learning about the **Tzolkin calendar**, the significance of gods like **Balac** (the war god) and **Ekahau** (the traveler and cacao god), and the divine right of Maya kings.

You'll interact with several NPCs, including **Joanna Riggs** (the curator), **Henrik Van Der Hune** (a Mayan expert), **Alejandro del Rio** (a museum employee), and **Taylor Sinclair** (the intern coordinator). Nancy's desk in the lab serves as your main quest tracker, with a to-do list that updates as you progress.

The game offers two difficulty modes: **Junior Detective** (more hints, easier puzzles) and **Senior Detective** (fewer hints, harder challenges). 

**Technical Note:** The game shows its age—it was released in 2002, and the graphics are rough by modern standards. Using **DGVoodoo2** to force a resolution bump from 640x480 to 1920x1080 results in a stretched widescreen image with distorted, hard-to-read text. It's playable, but not pretty. That said, the nostalgic charm and engaging mystery make it worth pushing through the visual roughness.

## Notes & Observations

*(These are my raw notes from while I was playing—some spoilers involved!)*

### 🖥️ Technical & Visual Impressions
*   **Graphics & Age:** The game definitely shows its age (2002). The graphics are a bit "horrible" by modern standards, but that's the charm of retro gaming.
*   **Resolution Struggles:** I managed to forcefully enhance the resolution from 600x400 to 1920x1080 using **DGVoodoo2**. It worked... sort of. The game just became a wide-screen stretch, and the in-game text is highly distorted and tough to read.
*   **Nostalgic Drive:** Despite the technical headaches and visual roughness, I'm pushing forward. I grew up watching my brother play this, and I never had the chance to play it myself until now. That nostalgia is a powerful motivator to see this through.

### 🏛️ The Museum & The Maya
*   **Meeting the Boss:** Finally met **Joanna Riggs**, the curator. She’s giving major "rigid academic" energy—cares more about her reputation than breathing. Her office is a flex, though: massive photo of the **Great Plaza of Tikal** and shelves overflowing with artifacts.
*   **The Workspace:** I’ve inherited the desk from the previous intern, **Sonny Joon**. Found some of his notes... this guy was "wacky" to say the least. Obsessed with aliens and doodles. He’s like a legend in the intern world.
*   **The Mystery:** The museum is a crime scene. A priceless jade carving of King Pacal was stolen, and the thief left a **red handprint**. It turns out the "blood" is actually **Cinnabar** (mercury sulfide). The Maya used it to highlight lines in their carvings. It's toxic, symbolic, and very dramatic.
*   **Crash Course in Mythology:** The game is basically a Maya history lesson in disguise, and I’m here for it. The god roster is stacked:
    *   **Itzamna (The Big Boss):** Supreme God, Lord of the Heavens. Name literally means "Lizard House" (weird flex, but okay). He invented writing and the calendar. Also, apparently the husband of Ixchel.
    *   **Ixchel (Moon Goddess):** Major duality vibes here. She’s the goddess of the moon, medicine, and weaving, but can also bring storms and destruction. She’s often depicted with a snake in her hair.
    *   **Ahau Kin (Sun God):** "Sun-faced Lord." He travels the sky by day and turns into a JAGUAR at night to prowl the underworld. That is objectively the coolest commute ever.
    *   **Chac (Rain God):** The storm bringer. Vital for crops, but scary if you’re caught in his weather.
    *   **Ekahau (Traveler’s God):** Also the god of **Cacao** (Chocolate!). Merchants loved him. He’s often shown with a black face or stripes. Guide me through this museum, cocoa king.
    *   **Yum Kaax (Lord of the Forest):** Guardian of wild plants and animals. Hunters had to ask his permission before taking game. Respect nature, or else.
    *   **Balac (War God):** The scary one. Found an **Offering Bowl** dedicated to him (dating to ca. 850 CE). Deciphered the glyph "Ek" (Black) on it.
    *   **Xbalanque (Jaguar God):** One of the "Hero Twins" from the *Popol Vuh*. He defeated the lords of the underworld in a ball game. Absolute legend.
*   **Time & Power:** The lore goes deep.
    *   **The Calendar:** The famous **Tzolkin calendar** isn't just a calendar; it's a sacred count computing a **260-day ceremonial year**.
    *   **Divine Right:** Maya Kings weren't just political or military leaders; they were essentially religious icons, believed to be handpicked by Itzamna himself.
    *   **Girl Power:** Here's a cool detail—the Supreme God didn't *only* pick dudes. There were female rulers too! The most famous one was **Lady Kanal Ikal**, who held the throne for a solid 20 years. Respect.

### 📜 Pacal the Great (The King of Kings)
I went down a massive rabbit hole on **K'Inich Janahb' Pacal**, aka **Lord Shield**. This guy is the main character of Maya history.
*   **The Prodigy:** He took the throne at **age 12** (615 CE). I was playing with toys at 12; he was ruling a civilization.
*   **The Reign:** Ruled for **68 years** (until 683 CE). That’s Queen Elizabeth II levels of longevity.
*   **The Nepo-Baby (Kind of):** His mom, **Lady Zac Kuk**, was the ruler before him. She passed the throne to him and then "ascended to deityhood." Power move.
*   **The Renaissance Man:** He wasn’t just a king; he was a **Priest-King** and a military commander. He rebuilt Palenque into the architectural masterpiece it is today.
*   **The Sarcophagus:** His tomb in the **Temple of the Inscriptions** is legendary.
    *   **The Lid:** The carving on his sarcophagus lid is famous. Some people think it looks like he’s piloting a spaceship ("Ancient Aliens," anyone?), but it’s actually depicting his descent into the underworld and rebirth as the Maize God.
    *   **The Jade Mask:** He was buried with a death mask made of over **300 fragments of jade**. It was meant to preserve his identity in the afterlife so the gods would recognize his royalty. Talk about an eternal flex.
