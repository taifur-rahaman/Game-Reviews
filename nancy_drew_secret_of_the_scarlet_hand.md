## Overview

Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand is the sixth installment in the Nancy Drew PC game series by Her Interactive. You play as Nancy Drew, a teenage detective who takes on an internship at the Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. What starts as a routine museum job quickly turns into a thrilling mystery when a priceless Mayan artifact is stolen, marked by a mysterious red handprint—the signature of the legendary "Scarlet Hand."

*(To be updated as I play)*

The game features a non-linear structure, allowing you to tackle puzzles and tasks in various orders. You'll interact with NPCs like Joanna Riggs (museum curator), Henrik Van Der Hune (Mayan expert), Alejandro del Rio (museum employee), and Taylor Sinclair (intern coordinator). The game offers two difficulty modes: Junior Detective (more hints, easier puzzles) and Senior Detective (fewer hints, harder challenges).

## Notes & Observations

*(These are my raw notes from while I was playing—some spoilers involved!)*

### 🖥️ Technical & Visual Impressions
*   **Graphics & Age:** The game definitely shows its age (2002). The graphics are a bit "horrible" by modern standards, but that's the charm of retro gaming.
*   **Resolution Struggles:** I managed to forcefully enhance the resolution from 600x400 to 1920x1080 using **DGVoodoo2**. It worked... sort of. The game just became a wide-screen stretch, and the in-game text is highly distorted and tough to read.
*   **Nostalgic Drive:** Despite the technical headaches and visual roughness, I'm pushing forward. I grew up watching my brother play this, and I never had the chance to play it myself until now. That nostalgia is a powerful motivator to see this through.
