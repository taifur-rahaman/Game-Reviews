## Overview

Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand is the sixth installment in the Nancy Drew PC game series by Her Interactive. You play as Nancy Drew, a teenage detective who takes on an internship at the Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. What starts as a routine museum job quickly turns into a thrilling mystery when a priceless Mayan artifact is stolen, marked by a mysterious red handprint—the signature of the legendary "Scarlet Hand."

The game features a non-linear structure, allowing you to tackle puzzles and tasks in various orders. You'll interact with NPCs like Joanna Riggs (museum curator), Henrik Van Der Hune (Mayan expert), Alejandro del Rio (museum employee), and Taylor Sinclair (intern coordinator). The game offers two difficulty modes: Junior Detective (more hints, easier puzzles) and Senior Detective (fewer hints, harder challenges).

## Notes & Observations

*(These are my raw notes from while I was playing—some spoilers involved!)*

### 🖥️ Technical & Visual Impressions
*   **Graphics & Age:** The game definitely shows its age (2002). The graphics are a bit "horrible" by modern standards, but that's the charm of retro gaming.
*   **Resolution Struggles:** I managed to forcefully enhance the resolution from 600x400 to 1920x1080 using **DGVoodoo2**. It worked... sort of. The game just became a wide-screen stretch, and the in-game text is highly distorted and tough to read.
*   **Nostalgic Drive:** Despite the technical headaches and visual roughness, I'm pushing forward. I grew up watching my brother play this, and I never had the chance to play it myself until now. That nostalgia is a powerful motivator to see this through.

### 🏛️ The Museum & The Maya
*   **Meeting the Boss:** Finally met **Joanna Riggs**, the museum curator and Nancy's supervisor. She gives off serious "rigid academic" vibes. Honestly, she seems like she cares about her research and literally nothing else. Her office is impressive though—she has this massive, stunning photograph of the **Great Plaza of Tikal, Guatemala** hanging up. It really sets the mood. Her shelves are cluttered with Maya artifacts; it's like a mini-museum inside the museum.
*   **The Connection:** There's also **Franklin Rose**, the guy who actually got Nancy this internship (friend of her dad). Haven't run into him yet, but he's the reason I'm stuck in this dusty (but cool) basement.
*   **Crash Course in Mythology:** I'm learning *so much* about the Maya pantheon just by poking around. The god roster is fascinating:
    *   **Itzamna:** The big boss, the **Supreme God**. Apparently, he's the one who "chooses" the kings.
    *   **Ahau Kin:** The **Sun God**. Classic.
    *   **Ekahau:** The **God of Travelers**. Keep him in mind for all the backtracking I'm doing.
    *   **Yum Kaax:** The **Corn God**. Yes, a god for corn. Vital stuff.
    *   **Balac:** The **War God**. Scary dude.
    *   **Xbalanque:** The **Jaguar God**. Probably the coolest name of the bunch.
*   **Artifact Sleuthing:** Found a fascinating **Offering Bowl** dating back to the Post-Classic period (ca. 850 CE). It’s specifically an offering vessel for the War God (Balac). I felt pretty smart deciphering the logograph on the base—it represents **"Ek,"** which translates to **"Black."**
*   **Time & Power:** The lore goes deep.
    *   **The Calendar:** The famous **Tzolkin calendar** isn't just a calendar; it's a sacred count computing a **260-day ceremonial year**.
    *   **Divine Right:** Maya Kings weren't just political or military leaders; they were essentially religious icons, believed to be handpicked by Itzamna himself.
    *   **Girl Power:** Here's a cool detail—the Supreme God didn't *only* pick dudes. There were female rulers too! The most famous one was **Lady Kanal Ikal**, who held the throne for a solid 20 years. Respect.
