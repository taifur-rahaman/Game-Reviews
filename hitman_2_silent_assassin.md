## Overview

Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is the sequel to Codename 47. You play as Agent 47, a genetically enhanced assassin who tries to leave his violent past behind and seek redemption in a Sicilian church. But, as always, the past catches up, and he's forced back into the trade to rescue his mentor, Father Vittorio.

## Story & Atmosphere

*(To be updated as I play)*

The game kicks off with 47 trying to live the vivid "quiet life"—he's literally gardening at a church in Sicily. It's a peaceful contrast to his usual violent work. But of course, it doesn't last. The local Don, Giuliani, decides it's a good idea to kidnap 47's mentor, Father Vittorio, and demand a $500,000 ransom. Big mistake. You never wake a sleeping dragon with ill intentions. Now 47 has to dig up his old gear and get back to work.

The search for Vittorio leads 47 to St. Petersburg, Russia. The atmosphere shifts from the sunny, open villas of Sicily to the cold, oppressive, and industrial streets of the post-Soviet era. There's a real sense of being back in the thick of a global conspiracy, with the ICA's Diana Burnwood providing Intel on high-ranking generals who seem to have a hand in Vittorio's disappearance.

## Gameplay

*(To be updated as I play)*

It's classic, high-tension stealth. The game clearly wants you to be a ghost. My first mission was a textbook example: I managed to infiltrate the villa, take out the target, and escape without harming a single guard or civilian. The game rewards that kind of precision with better rankings. The disguise system is key—blending in is often safer than sneaking around in the shadows.

St. Petersburg introduces a more complex tactical layer: the sewer system. It's not just about sneaking past guards; it's about navigating the underworld to find vantage points or bypass checkpoints entirely. The variety of tools is also expanding—from the precision of a sniper rifle to the raw, calculated destruction of car bombs. Seeing the "Silent Assassin" rating after a complex setup like planting dual car bombs is incredibly rewarding.

## Notes & Observations

*(These are my raw notes from while I was playing—some spoilers involved!)*

### 🇮🇹 Sicily
*   **The Sleeping Dragon:** It's honestly kind of wild seeing Agent 47, the world's most dangerous assassin, just chilling in a garden tending to plants. He really tried to leave it all behind. But this Don Giuliani guy... talk about picking the wrong target to extort. Kidnapping the priest (47's only friend!) for ransom? It's like he *wanted* to die.
*   **Anathema (Mission 1):** Started strong. I decided to play this strictly by the book—**Silent Assassin style**.
    *   **The Hit:** I slipped into the compound, found the Don, and took him out. Clean, professional. Didn't touch a hair on anyone else's head.
    *   **Ranking:** Got the **Professional** rating with the stealth bar maxed out. Felt satisfying to be a ghost.
    *   **The Twist:** High off the perfect kill, I rushed to the basement cells to save Father Vittorio... and he wasn't there. Just an empty chair. The intercom cracked straight away—Russian goons had dragged him off just moments before I got there. So much for a quick rescue. Looks like I'm traveling.

### 🇷🇺 St. Petersburg
*   **St. Petersburg Stakeout (Mission 2):** Okay, this mission was *peak* Hitman.
    *   **The Vibe:** I hop off the train in St. Petersburg and immediately realized I needed a vantage point. Found a sniper rifle in a locker (classic setup) and decided the streets were too hot. So, into the sewers I went. Gross, but effective.
    *   **The Hit:** Pure tension. I spent 80% of the mission wading through muck to get into the perfect position. Popped up from a manhole, lined up the shot while the generals were meeting, and—*boom*—General down. Clean.
    *   **The Getaway:** This was the best part. I didn't stick around to watch the panic. I slipped right back into the sewers before a single guard even twitched. Made it back to the station and caught the next train out of town. **In like a Spirit, out like a Ghost.** Nobody knows who did it, why they did it, or if I was ever even there. 10/10 stealth satisfaction.

*   **Kirov Park Meeting (Mission 3):** This mission was all about precision and timing. 
    *   **The Strategy:** Finished this mission with excellence. I hopped off the boat and immediately descended into the sewerage system to avoid the street-level patrols. 
    *   **The Hit:** Found the two target cars and carefully planted Car Bombs in both. It's a high-stakes move—one slip-up and the whole park would be swarming with guards.
    *   **The Escape:** Ascended back to the surface once the bombs were set, returned to the boat, and fled before the fireworks even started. 
    *   **Ranking:** Another **Silent Assassin** rating. The "ghost" strikes again.

*   **Tubeway Torpedo (Mission 4):** This one was different—a rescue mission deep in enemy territory.
    *   **The Mission:** Infiltrate the Russian military HQ and extract a prisoner. Absolute BADASS move.
    *   **The Rescue:** When I reached the prisoner, it seemed like 47 knew him. There was some history there, but 47 being 47, he didn't say a word.
    *   **The Exit:** We made it to the sewerage exit. The prisoner, probably grateful to be alive, tried to shake 47's hand. 47 looked at him. Looked at the hand. Then just... walked away. **Stone. Cold.** That's Agent 47 for you—he's not here to make friends. He's here to do the job.

*   **Invitation to a Party (Mission 5):** Time to crash a high-society gathering.
    *   **The Setup:** Infiltrate a party, kill the General, and steal vital information before the opposition agency does the same. Classic spy thriller stuff.
    *   **The Disguise:** I went in as a waiter. Perfect cover—nobody looks twice at the help.
    *   **Double Trouble:** Not only did I take out the General, but I also eliminated the opposition's assassin. LOL. Two birds, one stone. They never saw it coming.
    *   **The Escape:** Slipped out of the party before anyone even noticed anything was wrong. Just another night of catering, right?
    *   **Ranking:** **Professional** rating. Clean work, no unnecessary casualties.
