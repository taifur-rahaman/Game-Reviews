## Overview

Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is the sequel to Codename 47. You play as Agent 47, a genetically enhanced assassin who tries to leave his violent past behind and seek redemption in a Sicilian church. But, as always, the past catches up, and he's forced back into the trade to rescue his mentor, Father Vittorio.

## Story & Atmosphere

*(To be updated as I play)*

The game starts with 47 gardening at a church in Sicily. It's a peaceful contrast to his usual life. The atmosphere feels more refined than the first game, with a focus on travel across different locations like Italy, Russia, Japan, Malaysia, and India.

## Gameplay

*(To be updated as I play)*

Classic stealth gameplay. The disguise system is key here.

## Notes & Observations

*(These are my raw notes from while I was playing—some spoilers involved!)*

### 🇮🇹 Sicily
*   **The Garden:** It's weird seeing 47 doing regular gardening work. The contrast between his violent past and this peaceful life is striking.
