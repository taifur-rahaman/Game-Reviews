## Overview

Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is the sequel to Codename 47. You play as Agent 47, a genetically enhanced assassin who tries to leave his violent past behind and seek redemption in a Sicilian church. But, as always, the past catches up, and he's forced back into the trade to rescue his mentor, Father Vittorio.

## Story & Atmosphere

*(To be updated as I play)*

The game kicks off with 47 trying to live the vivid "quiet life"—he's literally gardening at a church in Sicily, confessing his sins, and trying to be a normal human being. It's a peaceful, almost jarring contrast to his usual violent work. But of course, peace was never an option. The local Don, Giuliani, decides it's a brilliant idea to kidnap 47's mentor, Father Vittorio, and demand a $500,000 ransom. Big mistake. You never wake a sleeping dragon, especially one with a barcode on the back of his head. Now 47 has to dig up his old gear from the garden shed (literally) and get back to work.

The search for Vittorio takes a sharp turn from the sunny villas of Sicily to the cold, oppressive streets of St. Petersburg, Russia. The atmosphere shift is intense—from golden hour lighting to grey, industrial post-Soviet gloom. There's a real sense of being back in the thick of a global conspiracy, with the ICA's Diana Burnwood feeding 47 intel on high-ranking generals who seem involved in Vittorio's disappearance. It feels less like a simple rescue mission and more like unraveling a massive spiderweb.

## Gameplay

*(To be updated as I play)*

It's classic, high-tension stealth, but refined. The game clearly wants you to be a ghost, not a rambo. My first mission was a textbook example: I managed to infiltrate the villa, take out the target, and escape without harming a single guard or civilian. The rush you get from walking past a guard who has no idea you're there to kill his boss? Unmatched. The disguise system is the MVP here—blending in is often safer (and cooler) than sneaking around in the shadows.

St. Petersburg introduces a more complex tactical layer: the sewer system. It's not just about sneaking past guards; it's about navigating the literal underworld to find vantage points or bypass checkpoints entirely. The variety of tools is also expanding—from the surgical precision of a sniper rifle to the raw, calculated destruction of car bombs. Seeing that "Silent Assassin" rating pop up after a complex setup involving dual car bombs and zero witnesses is arguably one of the most satisfying feelings in gaming.

## Verdict

Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a masterclass in player agency and emotional storytelling through gameplay. What starts as a simple redemption tale—a genetically engineered killer trying to find peace in a Sicilian church—becomes a globe-trotting odyssey that tests not just your skills, but your philosophy on how to approach violence.

The game's greatest strength is its flexibility. Every mission is a sandbox where you can be a ghost (Silent Assassin ratings, zero traces), a professional (clean kills, minimal collateral), or an absolute force of nature (Mass Murderer, Psychopath, Slayer). The fact that the game *allows* all these playstyles without judgment is brilliant. Some missions I was surgical—poisoned sushi with a transmitter, walking out while the target dies "naturally." Other times, especially when the mission felt personal (looking at you, Terminal Hospitality and Redemption at Gontranno), I became the storm.

The emotional arc is surprisingly powerful for a 2002 stealth game. Agent 47 starts the game gardening, confessing sins, trying to be human. By the end, when Sergei invades his sanctuary and takes Father Vittorio hostage, the mask comes off. That final mission isn't about ratings or professionalism—it's about *rage*. The SP12 shotgun rampage through the church wasn't just gameplay; it was catharsis. They violated his home, and he made sure none of them left.

The mission variety is excellent. From the atmospheric sniper work in freezing St. Petersburg sewers to the ninja-like poisoning in Japan, from time-sensitive bazaar hits in Afghanistan to the tense disguise work in Russian embassies—each location feels distinct. The game constantly forces you to adapt: sometimes stealth is king, sometimes you need to improvise (looking at you, Basement Killing smoke bomb chaos), and sometimes you just need to accept that today is a bad day for everyone involved.

The disguise system is the MVP. There's genuine tension in walking past a guard in a stolen uniform, wondering if he'll see through it. The satisfaction of infiltrating a heavily guarded compound by just *acting like you belong* never gets old.

That said, the game shows its age. The controls can be clunky, the AI is exploitable if you know the patterns, and some missions feel trial-and-error heavy (St. Petersburg Revisited with the cardboard cutout twist was brilliant but frustrating). The lack of mid-mission saves means one mistake can cost you 20 minutes of progress.

But here's the thing: despite the rough edges, Hitman 2 *respects* you. It doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't force a playstyle. It gives you tools, objectives, and consequences, then steps back and says "show me who you are." And over 20 missions spanning Sicily, Russia, Japan, Malaysia, Afghanistan, and India, I showed the game exactly who Agent 47 is: a professional when the job demands it, a ghost when stealth is required, and an unstoppable force when you threaten what's his.

The journey from peaceful gardener to vengeful protector, with stops at "surgical assassin" and "absolute psychopath" along the way, is one I won't forget. This is a game that understands that sometimes the best stories aren't told through cutscenes—they're told through the choices you make when no one's watching.

**Final Thought:** You came to my home. You took my mentor. You made the worst mistake of your life. And I made sure you never made another one. That's Hitman 2 in a nutshell: consequences, agency, and a bald man with a barcode who just wanted to tend his garden in peace.

**Rating: ★★★★⯪ (Epic Loot)** - Excellent stealth sandbox with memorable moments and genuine player freedom, held back only by dated controls and occasional trial-and-error design.

## Notes & Observations

*(These are my raw notes from while I was playing—some spoilers involved!)*

### 🇮🇹 Sicily
*   **The Sleeping Dragon:** It’s wild seeing Agent 47, a literal engineered killing machine, just lovingly tending to his garden. He really thought he could just retire. But Don Giuliani had a death wish, I guess. Kidnapping Father Vittorio (47's only friend and spiritual anchor) for a $500k ransom? That's not a business move; that's suicide by assassin.
*   **Anathema (Mission 1):** Started strong. I promised myself I’d play this by the book—**Silent Assassin or bust**.
    *   **The Approach:** Slipped into the compound like a shadow. avoided the mailman, dodged the guards. Found the Don on his balcony.
    *   **The Hit:** Took him out quickly. No drama, no noise. Didn't touch a hair on anyone else's head. Professionalism at its finest.
    *   **The Ranking:** Bagged the **Professional** rating with a maxed-out stealth bar. Felt good to be back in the suit.
    *   **The Twist:** High off the perfect kill, I rushed to the basement cells to save Vittorio... and he was gone. Just an empty chair and a mocking Russian voice on the intercom. The pros took him. Looks like my retirement is officially over.

### 🇷🇺 St. Petersburg
*   **St. Petersburg Stakeout (Mission 2):** Okay, this mission was *peak* Hitman atmosphere.
    *   **The Vibe:** Stepped off the train into the freezing Russian cold. The shift from Sicily is jarring. I immediately realized the streets were a death trap, so I did what any self-respecting assassin would do: I went to the sewers.
    *   **The Wait:** Spent solid 20 minutes just wading through muck to get the perfect angle. Found a sniper rifle in a locker (classic setup).
    *   **The Hit:** Popped up from a manhole, heart racing. The generals were meeting in a glass-walled room. Identified the target, exhaled, squeezed trigger. *Pink mist.* General down.
    *   **The Getaway:** Slipped back into the sewers before the glass even hit the floor. Caught the train out of town while the guards were still running in circles. **In like a Spirit, out like a Ghost.** 10/10 satisfaction.

*   **Kirov Park Meeting (Mission 3):** All about timing and explosives.
    *   **The Strategy:** Why shoot someone when you can just blow up their fancy cars? I avoided the street patrols by hugging the shadows.
    *   **The Setup:** Placed car bombs on both targets' limos. It’s risky—if a guard spots you fiddling with the chassis, it’s game over.
    *   **The Boom:** I was already halfway back to my boat when the fireworks started. Two explosions, two targets down.
    *   **The Ranking:** Another **Silent Assassin**. They never even saw me coming.

*   **Tubeway Torpedo (Mission 4):** A rescue op deep in enemy territory.
    *   **The Infiltration:** Had to break into a Russian military HQ to extract a prisoner. Felt like I was in a Bond movie, but with less talking and more strangling.
    *   **The Reunion:** Reached the prisoner. 47 clearly knew him—there was some heavy history there—but he didn't say a word. Just business.
    *   **The Coldness:** We made it to the sewer exit. The guy tries to thank 47, maybe shake his hand. 47 just looks at him, dead-eyed, and walks away. **Ice cold.** That’s my boy. He’s not here for friends; he’s here for the job.

*   **Invitation to a Party (Mission 5):** Time to crash high society.
    *   **The Disguise:** Infiltrated a lavish embassy party as a waiter. The best disguise is one where people are *supposed* to ignore you.
    *   **The Double Tap:** The objective was to kill the General and secure a suitcase. But twist: an enemy assassin was also there to kill the General. I waited for *him* to make a move, then took them *both* out. Two birds, one stone, zero witnesses.
    *   **The Escape:** Slipped out the back door with the suitcase while the guests were still sipping champagne.
    *   **The Ranking:** **Professional**. Smooth as silk.

### 🇯🇵 Japan
*   **Tracking Hayamoto (Mission 6):** This mission was legendary. Absolute ninja fantasy.
    *   **The Setup:** Need to kill Hayamoto Jr. to get to his dad. The catch? Do it without *anyone* knowing.
    *   **The Dish:** Sneaked into the kitchen and found the fugu (blowfish) being prepped. Added just a *tiny* bit of poison. Oh, and slipped a tracking transmitter into the sushi roll. Multitasking!
    *   **The Wait:** I hid outside and just waited. Hayamoto Jr. sits down, eats his sushi, and... *thud*.
    *   **The Result:** He died right there at the table. To the guards, it just looked like a tragic case of bad fish. No suspicion, no alarm. **Silent Assassin** rating achieved.

*   **Hidden Valley (Mission 7):** A change of pace. The snow was blinding.
    *   **The Approach:** I tried to be a ghost, but the snipers in the towers made it impossible. So I switched gears.
    *   **Shadow Warrior:** Instead of pure avoidance, I became a predator. Lurking in the snowy trenches. If a guard walked into the dark alone, he didn't walk out.
    *   **The Philosophy:** It wasn't clean, but it was effective. They knew *something* was out there, but they couldn't see me until it was too late.
    *   **The Ranking:** **Shadow**. Fitting. I wasn't invisible, but I was terrifying.

*   **At the Gates (Mission 8):** Infiltration 101: Act like you belong.
    *   **The Move:** Took down a guard, stole his uniform, and just... walked in.
    *   **The Deception:** The tension of walking right past a guard, wondering if he'll see through the disguise... incredible. But I kept my cool.
    *   **The Objective:** Shut down the security grid from the inside. strolled through the castle grounds, flipped the switch, and walked into the inner sanctum. No alarms.
    *   **The Lesson:** Confidence is the ultimate disguise.

*   **Shogun Showdown (Mission 9):** The finale of the Japan arc.
    *   **The Method:** Back to perfect form. Infiltrated the castle proper.
    *   **The Kill:** Made it to Hayamoto's private quarters. He was an old man, paranoid and surrounded by guards, but he wasn't safe. Fiber wire. Personal. Silent.
    *   **The Escape:** Walked out the front gate. The guards bowed to me (in disguise). If only they knew their master was already cooling on the floor upstairs.
    *   **The Ranking:** **Silent Assassin**. The Hayamoto family is history, and 47 disappears like smoke. Perfect arc.

### 🇲🇾 Malaysia
*   **Basement Killing (Mission 10):** This mission was a rollercoaster of improv.
    *   **The Pizza Setup:** I went in with just a fiber wire and a smoke bomb. Sparse loadout, high confidence. Found out my target (the hacker) had ordered a pizza. Classic nerd move.
    *   **The Infiltration:** Disguised myself as the pizza boy. Nobody questions a guy with a pepperoni pie. Breezed through security.
    *   **The Hit:** Made my way to the basement. It was just him and me. Fiber wire out, problem solved. Clean. He’s gone, and nobody even knows he’s missing yet.
    *   **The Chaos:** The problem was the elevator—heavily guarded, and I was fresh out of access cards. So, I got creative. I chucked a smoke bomb at the fire alarm.
    *   **The Escape:** In the minute of confusion that followed, I shot out the security camera (no witnesses, right?) and slipped into the elevator. Efficient? Maybe not. Effective? Absolutely.
    *   **Ranking:** **Professional**. A bit messy with the alarm, but the job got done.

*   **The Graveyard Shift (Mission 11):** Now *this* was the perfect ghost run. Zero kills. Zero trace.
    *   **The Objective:** Simple on paper: plant a hacking device on the server. The catch? I needed a high-security keycard to even get close.
    *   **The Sleeper:** Spotted a supervisor. Instead of killing him, I used anesthetic. He slumped over, looking like he just had one too many beers at lunch.
    *   **The Heist:** Stole his uniform and the keycard. Walked right past the guards like I owned the place.
    *   **The Plant & Exit:** Sauntered into the server room, planted the device, and walked out. Supervisor wakes up with a headache and no card; I walk away with a win.
    *   **Ranking:** **Professional** (Wait, how did I not get Silent Assassin? Maybe the body was found? Still, zero deaths is a win in my book). **Ghost status confirmed.**

*   **The Jacuzzi Job (Mission 12):** Chaos. Absolute chaos.
    *   **The Plan:** There was no plan. I was tired of sneaking.
    *   **The Execution:** Walked straight up to the penthouse and just started blasting. No stealth, no disguises, just hot lead.
    *   **The Body Count:** Everyone. The guards, the target, anyone who looked at me funny.
    *   **The Loot:** Grabbed the statue, grabbed the money, and ran.
    *   **Ranking:** **Slayer**. Honestly? It felt good to let loose after all that crawling around in sewers. Sometimes you just need to clear the room.

### 🇦🇫 Afghanistan
*   **Murder at the Bazaar (Mission 13):** Time is of the essence.
    *   **The Pressure:** This mission was fun, but it's a race against the clock. From the moment you start, the window of opportunity is ticking. If you don't move fast, the targets disappear for a while, and you're stuck waiting.
    *   **The Strategy:** I learned quickly that hesitation is the enemy here. Had to sprint from the start, navigate the bazaar, and get into position before the opportunity closed.
    *   **The Hit:** Once I got the timing down and positioned myself properly, taking out the targets was surprisingly easy. The hard part was the setup, not the execution.
    *   **The Lesson:** Speed matters. No time for overthinking or scouting. You need to know your route and commit immediately.
    *   **Ranking:** **Professional**. Clean work once I figured out the timing puzzle.

*   **The Motorcade Interception (Mission 14):** Textbook sniper mission.
    *   **The Setup:** The agency had already done the heavy lifting—smuggled a sniper rifle into the city for me. My job? Find it, find the vantage point, wait for the target, and take the shot.
    *   **The Execution:** Straight-cut simplicity. No elaborate disguises, no complex infiltration. Just pure marksmanship. Located the rifle, set up position, waited for the motorcade to roll through.
    *   **The Shot:** Target in sight. One clean shot. Target down.
    *   **The Escape:** Packed up and disappeared before anyone could even process what happened.
    *   **The Vibe:** Sometimes the best missions are the simple ones. No overthinking, no complications. Just professional work.
    *   **Ranking:** **Silent Assassin**. In and out like a ghost.

*   **Tunnel Rat (Mission 15):** Straight forward, no frills.
    *   **The Approach:** Didn't bother with the typical stealth mode this time. No sneaking around, no elaborate disguises.
    *   **The Method:** Just went in and did the job. Silent, but direct. Every single one went down with a headshot.
    *   **The Efficiency:** No alarms were triggered, but not because I was hiding—because everyone died before they could suspect anything was wrong. They didn't know what hit them until the moment they died.
    *   **The Result:** Clean kills, zero suspicion. By the time anyone could've raised an alarm, there was no one left to raise it.
    *   **Ranking:** **Cleaner**. Not invisible, but effective. The job got done.

### 🇮🇳 India
*   **Temple City Ambush (Mission 16):** I don't know what came over me.
    *   **The Snap:** Something just... broke. Grabbed the SMG and decided today wasn't about precision or professionalism.
    *   **The Rampage:** Started shooting and didn't stop. Civilians, guards, targets—everyone. No one was spared. No mercy, no hesitation.
    *   **The Carnage:** Bodies everywhere. The temple became a massacre site. This wasn't an assassination; this was pure chaos.
    *   **The Aftermath:** When the smoke cleared, there was nothing left but silence and corpses. The targets? Dead. Everyone else? Also dead.
    *   **Ranking:** **Psychopath**. Yeah, that tracks. Sometimes you just need to let the demons out.

*   **The Death of Hannelore (Mission 17):** Back to form. Pure professionalism.
    *   **The Disguise:** Wore the clothing of the patients. Blended right in. Nobody questions someone in a hospital gown shuffling around.
    *   **The Method:** Found the doctor's tea. Added poison. Ironic, isn't it? A doctor, killed by something she was about to consume. Poetic justice.
    *   **The Execution:** She drank it. She died. Simple as that.
    *   **The Escape:** Walked out. No bloodshed. Absolutely none. Not a single drop. Just a quiet, clinical elimination.
    *   **The Cleanse:** After the chaos of Temple City, this felt like redemption. Proof that I can still do this the right way.
    *   **Ranking:** **Silent Assassin**. Clean, precise, professional. This is who 47 really is.

*   **Terminal Hospitality (Mission 18):** And we're back to chaos. LOL.
    *   **The Snap (Again):** I don't know what it is about these India missions, but something just flips a switch in my brain.
    *   **The Arsenal:** Picked up an AK47 and decided that subtlety was overrated. Again.
    *   **The Rampage:** Started with the target, but why stop there? The entire medical island became a war zone. Guards, staff, patients—everyone.
    *   **The Justification:** Here's the thing though—they all deserved it. The whole hospital was just a front for the Cult Leader who stole a warhead to destroy civilians. So really, I was doing the world a favor.
    *   **The Carnage:** No survivors. Not a single one. The entire island was cleared. If you were there, you're not anymore.
    *   **The Aftermath:** When the dust settled, there was just silence. And bodies. So many bodies.
    *   **Ranking:** **Mass Murderer**. Yeah, that's a new one. But honestly? No regrets. They were all complicit.

### 🇷🇺 St. Petersburg (Return)
*   **St. Petersburg Revisited (Mission 19):** The most tricky mission so far. Full circle back to Russia.
    *   **The Setup:** Got the sniper rifle from the station. But here's the kicker—the ammo was in a completely different location. WHY? Who does that? It's like hiding your car keys in a different building.
    *   **The Decoy:** After sneaking around to collect both the rifle AND the ammo, I finally made it to the sniping position. Lined up the shot. Pulled the trigger. Target didn't die. What the hell?
    *   **The Twist:** Went to the room to investigate. The "target" was a fucking cardboard cutout. A CARDBOARD. I've been played.
    *   **The Restart:** Had to restart the entire mission. This time, I scouted the perimeter more carefully and found an agent positioned at a window with a sniper rifle. The real threat.
    *   **The Real Hit:** This time I went to the main building quietly. Found the agent. Fiber wire. Personal and silent. He never saw it coming.
    *   **The Reveal:** A cutscene triggered. It was Agent 17—hired specifically to protect Sergei and kill ME. So this whole mission was a trap. They knew I was coming.
    *   **The Objective Shift:** After killing Agent 17, the objective changed from "eliminate target" to "escape." Classic bait-and-switch.
    *   **The Escape:** Took Agent 17's disguise and walked out in the open. Blended right into the crowd and escaped via metro. They were looking for Agent 47, not Agent 17.
    *   **The Irony:** Escaped wearing the disguise of the man sent to kill me. Poetic.
    *   **Ranking:** **Expert**. This mission tested everything—patience, adaptability, and the ability to pivot when the plan falls apart.

### 🇮🇹 Sicily (Return)
*   **Redemption at Gontranno (Mission 20):** YOU CAME TO MY HOME? YOU MADE THE WORST MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE.
    *   **The Violation:** Sergei and his goons had the AUDACITY to come to my sanctuary. MY HOME. The church in Sicily where I found peace. They took Father Vittorio hostage. In MY house.
    *   **The Awakening:** This wasn't a mission. This was personal. I grabbed my trusty old SP12 shotgun—the one I thought I'd never need again—and became the storm.
    *   **The Rampage:** There were no civilians here. Just me, my mentor, and the enemies who dared to violate my sanctuary. I blazed through them like Rambo. Every. Single. One.
    *   **The Philosophy:** I spared NO ONE. Not a single soul. You don't come to a man's home, threaten his family, and expect mercy. This is what happens when you wake a sleeping dragon.
    *   **The Message:** They came to take. I made sure none of them left. This is MY home. MY sanctuary. And they learned that lesson the hard way.
    *   **The Aftermath:** When the smoke cleared, Father Vittorio was safe. The church was painted red, but it was MY red. Justice served with a shotgun.
    *   **Ranking:** TBD. But honestly? I don't care about the rating. This was about sending a message: Never. Touch. What's. Mine.
