## Overview

Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is the sequel to Codename 47. You play as Agent 47, a genetically enhanced assassin who tries to leave his violent past behind and seek redemption in a Sicilian church. But, as always, the past catches up, and he's forced back into the trade to rescue his mentor, Father Vittorio.

## Story & Atmosphere

*(To be updated as I play)*

The game kicks off with 47 trying to live the vivid "quiet life"—he's literally gardening at a church in Sicily, confessing his sins, and trying to be a normal human being. It's a peaceful, almost jarring contrast to his usual violent work. But of course, peace was never an option. The local Don, Giuliani, decides it's a brilliant idea to kidnap 47's mentor, Father Vittorio, and demand a $500,000 ransom. Big mistake. You never wake a sleeping dragon, especially one with a barcode on the back of his head. Now 47 has to dig up his old gear from the garden shed (literally) and get back to work.

The search for Vittorio takes a sharp turn from the sunny villas of Sicily to the cold, oppressive streets of St. Petersburg, Russia. The atmosphere shift is intense—from golden hour lighting to grey, industrial post-Soviet gloom. There's a real sense of being back in the thick of a global conspiracy, with the ICA's Diana Burnwood feeding 47 intel on high-ranking generals who seem involved in Vittorio's disappearance. It feels less like a simple rescue mission and more like unraveling a massive spiderweb.

## Gameplay

*(To be updated as I play)*

It's classic, high-tension stealth, but refined. The game clearly wants you to be a ghost, not a rambo. My first mission was a textbook example: I managed to infiltrate the villa, take out the target, and escape without harming a single guard or civilian. The rush you get from walking past a guard who has no idea you're there to kill his boss? Unmatched. The disguise system is the MVP here—blending in is often safer (and cooler) than sneaking around in the shadows.

St. Petersburg introduces a more complex tactical layer: the sewer system. It's not just about sneaking past guards; it's about navigating the literal underworld to find vantage points or bypass checkpoints entirely. The variety of tools is also expanding—from the surgical precision of a sniper rifle to the raw, calculated destruction of car bombs. Seeing that "Silent Assassin" rating pop up after a complex setup involving dual car bombs and zero witnesses is arguably one of the most satisfying feelings in gaming.

## Notes & Observations

*(These are my raw notes from while I was playing—some spoilers involved!)*

### 🇮🇹 Sicily
*   **The Sleeping Dragon:** It’s wild seeing Agent 47, a literal engineered killing machine, just lovingly tending to his garden. He really thought he could just retire. But Don Giuliani had a death wish, I guess. Kidnapping Father Vittorio (47's only friend and spiritual anchor) for a $500k ransom? That's not a business move; that's suicide by assassin.
*   **Anathema (Mission 1):** Started strong. I promised myself I’d play this by the book—**Silent Assassin or bust**.
    *   **The Approach:** Slipped into the compound like a shadow. avoided the mailman, dodged the guards. Found the Don on his balcony.
    *   **The Hit:** Took him out quickly. No drama, no noise. Didn't touch a hair on anyone else's head. Professionalism at its finest.
    *   **The Ranking:** Bagged the **Professional** rating with a maxed-out stealth bar. Felt good to be back in the suit.
    *   **The Twist:** High off the perfect kill, I rushed to the basement cells to save Vittorio... and he was gone. Just an empty chair and a mocking Russian voice on the intercom. The pros took him. Looks like my retirement is officially over.

### 🇷🇺 St. Petersburg
*   **St. Petersburg Stakeout (Mission 2):** Okay, this mission was *peak* Hitman atmosphere.
    *   **The Vibe:** Stepped off the train into the freezing Russian cold. The shift from Sicily is jarring. I immediately realized the streets were a death trap, so I did what any self-respecting assassin would do: I went to the sewers.
    *   **The Wait:** Spent solid 20 minutes just wading through muck to get the perfect angle. Found a sniper rifle in a locker (classic setup).
    *   **The Hit:** Popped up from a manhole, heart racing. The generals were meeting in a glass-walled room. Identified the target, exhaled, squeezed trigger. *Pink mist.* General down.
    *   **The Getaway:** Slipped back into the sewers before the glass even hit the floor. Caught the train out of town while the guards were still running in circles. **In like a Spirit, out like a Ghost.** 10/10 satisfaction.

*   **Kirov Park Meeting (Mission 3):** All about timing and explosives.
    *   **The Strategy:** Why shoot someone when you can just blow up their fancy cars? I avoided the street patrols by hugging the shadows.
    *   **The Setup:** Placed car bombs on both targets' limos. It’s risky—if a guard spots you fiddling with the chassis, it’s game over.
    *   **The Boom:** I was already halfway back to my boat when the fireworks started. Two explosions, two targets down.
    *   **The Ranking:** Another **Silent Assassin**. They never even saw me coming.

*   **Tubeway Torpedo (Mission 4):** A rescue op deep in enemy territory.
    *   **The Infiltration:** Had to break into a Russian military HQ to extract a prisoner. Felt like I was in a Bond movie, but with less talking and more strangling.
    *   **The Reunion:** Reached the prisoner. 47 clearly knew him—there was some heavy history there—but he didn't say a word. Just business.
    *   **The Coldness:** We made it to the sewer exit. The guy tries to thank 47, maybe shake his hand. 47 just looks at him, dead-eyed, and walks away. **Ice cold.** That’s my boy. He’s not here for friends; he’s here for the job.

*   **Invitation to a Party (Mission 5):** Time to crash high society.
    *   **The Disguise:** Infiltrated a lavish embassy party as a waiter. The best disguise is one where people are *supposed* to ignore you.
    *   **The Double Tap:** The objective was to kill the General and secure a suitcase. But twist: an enemy assassin was also there to kill the General. I waited for *him* to make a move, then took them *both* out. Two birds, one stone, zero witnesses.
    *   **The Escape:** Slipped out the back door with the suitcase while the guests were still sipping champagne.
    *   **The Ranking:** **Professional**. Smooth as silk.

### 🇯🇵 Japan
*   **Tracking Hayamoto (Mission 6):** This mission was legendary. Absolute ninja fantasy.
    *   **The Setup:** Need to kill Hayamoto Jr. to get to his dad. The catch? Do it without *anyone* knowing.
    *   **The Dish:** Sneaked into the kitchen and found the fugu (blowfish) being prepped. Added just a *tiny* bit of poison. Oh, and slipped a tracking transmitter into the sushi roll. Multitasking!
    *   **The Wait:** I hid outside and just waited. Hayamoto Jr. sits down, eats his sushi, and... *thud*.
    *   **The Result:** He died right there at the table. To the guards, it just looked like a tragic case of bad fish. No suspicion, no alarm. **Silent Assassin** rating achieved.

*   **Hidden Valley (Mission 7):** A change of pace. The snow was blinding.
    *   **The Approach:** I tried to be a ghost, but the snipers in the towers made it impossible. So I switched gears.
    *   **Shadow Warrior:** Instead of pure avoidance, I became a predator. Lurking in the snowy trenches. If a guard walked into the dark alone, he didn't walk out.
    *   **The Philosophy:** It wasn't clean, but it was effective. They knew *something* was out there, but they couldn't see me until it was too late.
    *   **The Ranking:** **Shadow**. Fitting. I wasn't invisible, but I was terrifying.

*   **At the Gates (Mission 8):** Infiltration 101: Act like you belong.
    *   **The Move:** Took down a guard, stole his uniform, and just... walked in.
    *   **The Deception:** The tension of walking right past a guard, wondering if he'll see through the disguise... incredible. But I kept my cool.
    *   **The Objective:** Shut down the security grid from the inside. strolled through the castle grounds, flipped the switch, and walked into the inner sanctum. No alarms.
    *   **The Lesson:** Confidence is the ultimate disguise.

*   **Shogun Showdown (Mission 9):** The finale of the Japan arc.
    *   **The Method:** Back to perfect form. Infiltrated the castle proper.
    *   **The Kill:** Made it to Hayamoto's private quarters. He was an old man, paranoid and surrounded by guards, but he wasn't safe. Fiber wire. Personal. Silent.
    *   **The Escape:** Walked out the front gate. The guards bowed to me (in disguise). If only they knew their master was already cooling on the floor upstairs.
    *   **The Ranking:** **Silent Assassin**. The Hayamoto family is history, and 47 disappears like smoke. Perfect arc.

### 🇲🇾 Malaysia
*   **Basement Killing (Mission 10):** This mission was a rollercoaster of improv.
    *   **The Pizza Setup:** I went in with just a fiber wire and a smoke bomb. Sparse loadout, high confidence. Found out my target (the hacker) had ordered a pizza. Classic nerd move.
    *   **The Infiltration:** Disguised myself as the pizza boy. Nobody questions a guy with a pepperoni pie. Breezed through security.
    *   **The Hit:** Made my way to the basement. It was just him and me. Fiber wire out, problem solved. Clean. He’s gone, and nobody even knows he’s missing yet.
    *   **The Chaos:** The problem was the elevator—heavily guarded, and I was fresh out of access cards. So, I got creative. I chucked a smoke bomb at the fire alarm.
    *   **The Escape:** In the minute of confusion that followed, I shot out the security camera (no witnesses, right?) and slipped into the elevator. Efficient? Maybe not. Effective? Absolutely.
    *   **Ranking:** **Professional**. A bit messy with the alarm, but the job got done.

*   **The Graveyard Shift (Mission 11):** Now *this* was the perfect ghost run. Zero kills. Zero trace.
    *   **The Objective:** Simple on paper: plant a hacking device on the server. The catch? I needed a high-security keycard to even get close.
    *   **The Sleeper:** Spotted a supervisor. Instead of killing him, I used anesthetic. He slumped over, looking like he just had one too many beers at lunch.
    *   **The Heist:** Stole his uniform and the keycard. Walked right past the guards like I owned the place.
    *   **The Plant & Exit:** Sauntered into the server room, planted the device, and walked out. Supervisor wakes up with a headache and no card; I walk away with a win.
    *   **Ranking:** **Professional** (Wait, how did I not get Silent Assassin? Maybe the body was found? Still, zero deaths is a win in my book). **Ghost status confirmed.**

*   **The Jacuzzi Job (Mission 12):** Chaos. Absolute chaos.
    *   **The Plan:** There was no plan. I was tired of sneaking.
    *   **The Execution:** Walked straight up to the penthouse and just started blasting. No stealth, no disguises, just hot lead.
    *   **The Body Count:** Everyone. The guards, the target, anyone who looked at me funny.
    *   **The Loot:** Grabbed the statue, grabbed the money, and ran.
    *   **Ranking:** **Slayer**. Honestly? It felt good to let loose after all that crawling around in sewers. Sometimes you just need to clear the room.

### 🇦🇫 Afghanistan
*   **Murder at the Bazaar (Mission 13):** Time is of the essence.
    *   **The Pressure:** This mission was fun, but it's a race against the clock. From the moment you start, the window of opportunity is ticking. If you don't move fast, the targets disappear for a while, and you're stuck waiting.
    *   **The Strategy:** I learned quickly that hesitation is the enemy here. Had to sprint from the start, navigate the bazaar, and get into position before the opportunity closed.
    *   **The Hit:** Once I got the timing down and positioned myself properly, taking out the targets was surprisingly easy. The hard part was the setup, not the execution.
    *   **The Lesson:** Speed matters. No time for overthinking or scouting. You need to know your route and commit immediately.
    *   **Ranking:** **Professional**. Clean work once I figured out the timing puzzle.
