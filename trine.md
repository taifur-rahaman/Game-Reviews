## Overview

Trine: Enhanced Edition is a physics-based puzzle-platformer developed by Frozenbyte that combines beautiful hand-painted visuals with clever environmental puzzles. Set in a vibrant fantasy world, the game allows players to control three distinct heroes—Amadeus the Wizard, Zoya the Thief, and Pontius the Knight—each with unique abilities essential for solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles. The Enhanced Edition includes improved graphics, online multiplayer, and additional content.

## Story & Atmosphere

The narrative follows three unlikely heroes bound together by the mystical Trine artifact. When an ancient evil threatens the kingdom, these three souls—a wizard who prefers books to battles, a thief seeking treasure, and a knight yearning for glory—are magically fused into a single entity. The story unfolds through a charming narrator whose voice carries the warmth of classic fairy tales.

The atmosphere is enchanting and painterly. Each level feels like stepping into a living storybook, with lush forests, crumbling ruins, and moonlit caverns rendered in rich, saturated colors. The orchestral soundtrack complements the visuals perfectly, creating a world that feels both whimsical and mysterious. Unlike the gritty realism of many modern games, Trine embraces pure fantasy escapism—a refreshing change of pace.

## Gameplay

The core gameplay revolves around switching between three characters to solve environmental puzzles and navigate platforming challenges. Amadeus can conjure boxes and planks, manipulate objects with magic, and levitate items. Zoya uses her grappling hook and bow for traversal and ranged combat. Pontius relies on his sword, shield, and brute strength to clear obstacles and defeat enemies.

The physics-based puzzles encourage creative problem-solving—there's often more than one way to overcome an obstacle. Combat is straightforward but satisfying, serving as a complement to the puzzle-solving rather than the main focus. The game supports both single-player (switching between characters) and cooperative multiplayer, where each player controls a different hero.

## Verdict

Rating and Verdict are still in process. I don't know how much I like this game until I complete it.
